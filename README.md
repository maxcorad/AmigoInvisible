# AmigoInvisible
Program to organize 'Amigo Invisible' (Spanish Secret Santa equivalent).

The script determines for every friend in a group whose 'amigo invisble' are they going to be. Then it will send an SMS to each person with the name of the friend to whom they have to give a present.

The information concerning the group of friends (names, phone numbers and set of incompatibilities) is provided from file or input.

For sending SMS, an AWS account is required (it may incurr in some costs).
